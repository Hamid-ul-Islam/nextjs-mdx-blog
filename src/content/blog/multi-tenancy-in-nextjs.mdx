## Introduction

Multi-tenant systems are crucial for modern SaaS applications, especially in
education technology. In this post, I'll walk you through my journey of building
a robust school management system using Next.js, highlighting the key
architectural decisions and technical challenges.

## Understanding Multi-Tenancy

Multi-tenancy means multiple organizations (schools, in our case) can use the
same application while keeping their data completely isolated. This approach
offers:

- Cost-effective infrastructure
- Simplified maintenance
- Scalable architecture

## Technology Stack

My chosen stack for this project included:

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- Supabase for Authentication
- Shadcn UI for components
- Vercel for deployment

## Database Design: The Isolation Strategy

The core of multi-tenancy lies in data isolation. I implemented a tenant-aware
database schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  slug TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  grade TEXT
);
```

By adding `organization_id` to each table, we ensure data remains strictly
separated.

## Authentication and Authorization

Supabase provided a powerful authentication mechanism. Each login associates a
user with their specific organization, implementing row-level security:

```typescript
// Middleware for tenant-specific access
export function withTenantAccess(handler) {
	return async (req, res) => {
		const session = await getServerSession()
		const organizationSlug = req.query.orgSlug

		if (!session || session.user.organizationSlug !== organizationSlug) {
			return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' })
		}

		return handler(req, res)
	}
}
```

## Dynamic Routing with Tenant Context

Next.js App Router enabled seamless tenant-specific routing:

```typescript
// app/[orgSlug]/dashboard/page.tsx
export default function DashboardPage({ params }) {
	const { orgSlug } = params
	// Fetch org-specific data
}
```

## Performance Considerations

To maintain performance, I implemented:

- Efficient database indexing
- Cached queries using Redis
- Selective data loading
- Optimized server-side rendering

## Deployment and Scaling

Vercel's platform made deployment straightforward, with built-in:

- Automatic scaling
- Global CDN
- Easy environment management

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

1. Implementing row-level security was complex
2. Careful query design prevents potential data leaks
3. Comprehensive testing is crucial for multi-tenant systems

## Conclusion

Building a multi-tenant school management system requires careful architectural
planning. Next.js provides powerful tools to create scalable, secure, and
performant applications.

## Next Steps

- Implement more granular role-based access control
- Add comprehensive audit logging
- Develop advanced reporting features

Happy coding! ðŸš€
